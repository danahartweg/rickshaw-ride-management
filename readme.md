## Rickshaw Ride Management

As a sample project that would access the Formstack API, this application would be intended to be used by local Rickshaw companies (such as Raleigh Rickshaw) as a value addition for their customers.

Each driver would be added to the companies Formstack account when they checked out a Rickshaw for the evening, and they would then be able to interact with those customers around them requesting rides through the appropriate Formstack form for their area.

There is no external data storage required, just access to the Formstack account.
